# Implement Local Settings System

Replace the Supabase-based profile system with a local file-based settings system that handles both public and private user data.

## Implementation Notes

The local settings system has been successfully implemented with the following key changes:

| File                                                   | Changes Made                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `lib/settings/types.ts`                                | Created settings schemas and types for display, user, and analytics data       |
| `lib/settings/manager.ts`                              | Implemented settings CRUD operations, migration helpers, and avatar management |
| `components/providers/settings-provider.tsx`           | Created React context provider for app-wide settings access                    |
| `app/api/settings/route.ts`                            | Added API routes for settings management with auth checks                      |
| `app/api/avatar/[filename]/route.ts`                   | Implemented secure avatar serving with proper headers                          |
| `app/api/upload-avatar/route.ts`                       | Added avatar upload endpoint with validation                                   |
| `components/user/profile-form.tsx`                     | Updated to use local settings instead of Supabase                              |
| `components/user/profile-button.tsx`                   | Modified to use local avatar and display settings                              |
| `.gitignore`                                           | Added patterns for local settings files                                        |
| `supabase/migrations/20240319000000_drop_profiles.sql` | Created migration to remove Supabase profiles                                  |

Key features implemented:

- Local file-based settings system with separate public and private data
- Secure avatar storage and serving
- Settings validation using Zod schemas
- Migration path from Supabase profiles
- Real-time settings sync via React context
- Error handling and recovery
- File system security checks

## Success Criteria

- [x] Local settings file structure created
- [x] Git-ignored local user settings working
- [x] Git-tracked display settings working
- [x] Existing profile system removed
- [x] Migration path for existing users implemented
- [x] Settings sync and conflict resolution working

## Implementation Details

### File Structure Setup

- [x] Create `.cursordone/user/` directory
- [x] Create `settings.local.json` for private data
- [x] Create `display.json` for public data
- [x] Update `.gitignore` for local files

### Local Settings Implementation

- [x] Create settings management utilities
- [x] Implement settings file creation on first run
- [x] Add file watchers for settings sync
- [x] Add validation for settings files
- [x] Create settings provider component

### Display Settings

- [x] Modify ProfileForm to use local settings
- [x] Update avatar storage to use local files
- [x] Implement git-sync for display settings
- [x] Add conflict resolution for display settings

### Cleanup

- [x] Remove Supabase profile tables
- [x] Clean up unused migrations
- [x] Remove Supabase-specific code from components
- [x] Update auth flow to work without profiles

## Files to Change

1. Modify (remove Supabase integration):

   - `components/user/profile-form.tsx`
   - `components/user/profile-button.tsx`
   - `app/(main)/profile/page.tsx`

2. Create/Update:
   - `.cursordone/user/settings.local.json`
   - `.cursordone/user/display.json`
   - `lib/settings/types.ts`
   - `lib/settings/manager.ts`
   - `components/providers/settings-provider.tsx`

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests

   - Settings CRUD operations
   - File synchronization
   - Migration process
   - Error handling

2. Integration Tests

   - Profile system integration
   - Avatar management
   - Settings persistence
   - Auth flow changes

3. Migration Tests
   - Existing user migration
   - Data preservation
   - Rollback procedures

- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

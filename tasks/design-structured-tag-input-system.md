Design a structured tag input system using the Command component, incorporating insights from the tag usage analysis to create an intuitive and efficient tagging experience.

## Requirements

### Command Component Integration
- [ ] Design Command component integration for tag input
- [ ] Define tag suggestion behavior and ranking
- [ ] Design keyboard shortcuts and navigation
- [ ] Plan typeahead/fuzzy search functionality
- [ ] Design tag creation flow for new tags

### Visual Design
- [ ] Design tag visual treatments and states
- [ ] Create tag category visualization system
- [ ] Design tag suggestion presentation
- [ ] Plan responsive behavior for mobile/desktop
- [ ] Design error states and validation feedback

### Interaction Design
- [ ] Define tag selection interactions
- [ ] Design bulk tag operations
- [ ] Plan tag editing/deletion flows
- [ ] Design tag organization features
- [ ] Define tag filtering/search interactions

### System Design
- [ ] Design tag data structure
- [ ] Plan tag suggestion algorithm
- [ ] Define tag validation rules
- [ ] Design tag storage optimization
- [ ] Plan tag relationship system

## Success Criteria
- Complete interaction flows documented
- Visual designs for all states created
- Keyboard shortcuts defined
- Mobile/desktop responsiveness planned
- Tag suggestion system designed
- Data structure optimizations planned

Integrate the Supabase client library to enable communication with the Supabase backend. Ensure the following:

1. Install the `@supabase/supabase-js` package.
2. Create a client initialization script that reads environment variables (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`).
3. Verify connectivity to the Supabase backend by performing a test query.

Deliverable:

- A functional Supabase client script.
- Successful test query against the backend.

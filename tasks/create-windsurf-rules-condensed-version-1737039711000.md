# Objective
Create a condensed version of the Cursor AI rules for Windsurf IDE users while maintaining the same core principles and guidance. The new rules file should be under 6000 characters while preserving the essential functionality and spirit of the original rules.

# Success Criteria
- [ ] Create `.windsurfrules` file
- [ ] Reduce total character count to below 6000 (currently 10,579 in .cursorrules)
- [ ] Maintain all critical rule categories and concepts
- [ ] Preserve core behavior guidelines for AI interactions
- [ ] Keep essential schemas for tasks, epics, and documentation
- [ ] Retain key git and ownership rules
- [ ] Verify readability and clarity of condensed rules

# Implementation Details
1. Analyze current .cursorrules structure and identify:
   - Core components that must be preserved
   - Areas that can be condensed
   - Redundant or overly verbose sections
   
2. Optimization strategies:
   - Remove redundant examples
   - Consolidate similar rules
   - Simplify verbose descriptions
   - Remove unnecessary whitespace
   - Keep only essential schema fields
   
3. Create new .windsurfrules file with optimized content

4. Verify character count and rule coverage

Analyze the current tag usage patterns across all tasks to inform the redesign of the tag input system. This analysis will provide the foundation for implementing a more structured tag input approach using the Command component.

## Requirements

### Data Collection
- [ ] Scan all task files for tag usage
- [ ] Create comprehensive list of unique tags
- [ ] Calculate tag frequency/usage statistics
- [ ] Identify common tag patterns and categories
- [ ] Document tag naming conventions (explicit and implicit)
- [ ] Map tag relationships and similarities

### Pattern Analysis
- [ ] Identify commonly co-occurring tags
- [ ] Find potential duplicate/similar tags
- [ ] Analyze tag naming patterns
- [ ] Document tag usage by epic/project area
- [ ] Identify temporal patterns in tag usage

### Usage Context
- [ ] Map all tag input/edit touchpoints in UI
- [ ] Document current tag creation workflows
- [ ] Identify pain points in current system
- [ ] Analyze tag usage in filtering/search
- [ ] Review tag display contexts

### Deliverables
- [ ] Comprehensive tag usage report
- [ ] Tag frequency matrix
- [ ] Suggested tag categories
- [ ] Pain points documentation
- [ ] Recommendations for new system

## Success Criteria
- Complete tag usage data collected
- Clear patterns and categories identified
- Pain points documented with examples
- Actionable recommendations for new system
- Data ready for design phase consumption

# Implement Performance Testing

Set up performance testing suite to measure and optimize system performance.

## Implementation Notes
- Remember to change status to "in progress" when starting this task
- Test thoroughly before marking as done
- Commit with message "feat: implement performance testing"

## Requirements Checklist

### Load Testing
- [ ] Setup k6 test suite
- [ ] Create load scenarios
- [ ] Add stress tests
- [ ] Implement benchmarks

### Performance Metrics

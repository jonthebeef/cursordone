Implement session handling for authenticated users. Ensure the following:

1. Save Supabase session tokens in a local configuration file.
2. Validate session tokens before allowing further CLI operations.
3. Handle session expiration gracefully, prompting the user to log in again.

Deliverable:

- Secure session management with error handling for expired or invalid sessions.

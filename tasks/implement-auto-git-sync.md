# Implement Automatic Git Sync

Implement automatic Git synchronization for tasks and epics, including background pull/push operations.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Auto-commit on task/epic changes
- [x] Background pull at configurable intervals
- [x] Smart batching of changes to prevent commit spam
- [x] Status indicators showing sync state
- [x] Configurable sync settings
- [x] Graceful handling of Git credentials

## Implementation Details

1. Git Operations

   - Implement auto-commit on task changes
   - Add background pull mechanism
   - Create smart batching system
   - Handle Git credentials securely

2. UI Integration

   - Add sync status indicators
   - Create settings interface
   - Show sync activity

3. Error Handling
   - Handle network issues
   - Manage Git operation failures
   - Provide user feedback

## Implementation Notes

The automated Git sync feature has been implemented with the following components:

| File                                         | Changes Made                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lib/utils/git.ts`                           | Created new utility module for Git operations including functions for commit, pull, push, status checking, and conflict detection |
| `lib/git-sync-manager.ts`                    | Implemented GitSyncManager class that handles automatic synchronization, file watching, and event emissions                       |
| `lib/settings/types.ts`                      | Extended settings schema to include Git sync configuration options                                                                |
| `components/GitSyncStatus.tsx`               | Created UI component to display sync status and allow manual sync triggering                                                      |
| `components/GitSyncSettings.tsx`             | Implemented settings form for configuring Git sync options                                                                        |
| `lib/contexts/GitSyncContext.tsx`            | Created context provider to make Git sync manager available throughout the app                                                    |
| `lib/hooks/use-git-sync.ts`                  | Added hook for easy access to Git sync functionality in components                                                                |
| `lib/hooks/use-settings.ts`                  | Created settings hook for managing user preferences                                                                               |
| `package.json`                               | Added chokidar dependency for file watching                                                                                       |
| `components/providers/git-sync-provider.tsx` | Created provider component for wrapping application                                                                               |
| `components/ui/side-nav.tsx`                 | Integrated Git sync status indicator in the side navigation                                                                       |

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Automatic File Watching**:

   - Watches tasks, epics, and docs directories for changes
   - Only triggers for markdown files
   - Uses stable file watching with debounce to prevent duplicate commits

2. **Smart Batching**:

   - Configurable threshold for number of files before immediate commit
   - Configurable timeout for batching changes together
   - Prevents commit spam by grouping related changes

3. **Sync Status Display**:

   - Real-time status indicators showing current sync state
   - Shows pending changes count
   - Displays last sync time
   - Visual indicators for errors or conflicts

4. **Configurable Settings**:

   - Enable/disable Git sync
   - Configure auto-pull interval
   - Toggle auto-push
   - Set batch thresholds and timeouts
   - Select directories to watch

5. **Error Handling**:

   - Detailed error messages for sync failures
   - Visual indicators for conflicts
   - Recovery mechanisms for network issues

6. **Git Credentials Handling**:
   - Uses system credentials store
   - Gracefully handles authentication errors
   - Provides clear feedback for credential issues

### Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

- Adding conflict resolution UI
- Implementing a more sophisticated credential management system
- Adding support for custom commit messages
- Creating a detailed activity log for sync operations

## Guidelines

- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

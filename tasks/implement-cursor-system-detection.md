# Implement .cursorrules Auto-integration

Create a system to automatically detect and integrate our task management rules into Cursor IDE's .cursorrules configuration.

## Implementation Details

1. Detection:

   - Check for existence of .cursorrules in workspace root
   - Verify if our task management rules are already present
   - Parse existing rules if present

2. Integration Process:

   - If no .cursorrules exists:
     - Create new file with our complete ruleset
     - Include version information
     - Set up all rule categories (content, tasks, git, etc.)
   - If .cursorrules exists:
     - Parse existing rules
     - Merge our rules without overwriting existing ones
     - Add new sections for task management
     - Preserve user customizations
     - Update version if needed

3. Rule Categories to Integrate:
   - Content structure rules (front matter schemas)
   - Task management rules
   - Git integration rules
   - AI behavior specifications
   - Pipeline integration rules

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Successfully detects presence/absence of .cursorrules
- [ ] Creates new file with complete ruleset if none exists
- [ ] Correctly merges rules into existing file if present
- [ ] Preserves existing user configurations
- [ ] Validates merged rules for consistency
- [ ] No disruption to existing Cursor functionality

## Technical Considerations

- Need to handle YAML parsing and merging
- Must preserve file formatting and comments
- Should handle version conflicts gracefully
- Must backup existing rules before modification

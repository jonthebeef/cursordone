Implement a system for archiving tasks that are no longer relevant or needed in the active task list, while preserving all task data and relationships. This helps maintain a focused task list while retaining historical information.

This task has been broken down into smaller, more manageable subtasks:

1. TSK-088: Implement core archive data structure (M)
2. TSK-089: Implement archive UI components (S)
3. TSK-090: Implement batch archive operations (M)
4. TSK-091: Implement archive search and filtering (S)
5. TSK-092: Implement epic archive integration (S)

The original requirements have been distributed across these subtasks. This task will be considered complete when all subtasks are completed.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

- Add ability to archive tasks individually or in batch
- Remove archived tasks from main task list UI
- Preserve all task data and files on disk
- Maintain relationships with epics and tags
- Enable easy restoration of archived tasks

### UI/UX

- Add archive action to task context menu
- Add batch archive capability in task list
- Show archive status in task details
- Provide feedback for archive/restore actions
- Smooth transitions when archiving/restoring
- Consider adding archive reason field

### Data Management

- Create storage system for archive status
- Track archive date and metadata
- Maintain all task relationships
- Handle conflicts during restore
- Preserve task order information
- Consider implementing auto-archive rules

### Search and Filtering

- Option to include archived tasks in searches
- Filter by archive status
- Clear indication when viewing archived tasks
- Maintain existing sort and filter capabilities
- Search within archived tasks

### Epic Integration

- Show archive status in epic views
- Update epic task counts appropriately
- Handle epic-level batch operations
- Maintain epic relationships for archived tasks

### Implementation Notes

- Store archive status in task metadata
- Add API endpoints for archive operations
- Update task list component for archive handling
- Implement proper error handling
- Consider performance implications for large archives

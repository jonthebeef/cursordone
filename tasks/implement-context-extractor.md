Create a system to extract and process context from markdown files, including front matter, content structure, and relationships.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Front matter parsing working correctly
- [ ] Markdown content properly parsed and structured
- [ ] Relationships extracted from content
- [ ] Context stored in database
- [ ] Change detection working
- [ ] Performance metrics within bounds

## Implementation Details

### Context Structure

```typescript
interface ParsedContext {
  frontMatter: {
    title: string;
    status: string;
    // ... other front matter fields
  };
  content: {
    sections: Section[];
    links: Link[];
    codeBlocks: CodeBlock[];
  };
  relationships: Relationship[];
  metadata: {
    wordCount: number;
    readingTime: number;
    complexity: number;
  };
}

interface Section {
  title: string;
  level: number;
  content: string;
  start: number; // Line number
  end: number; // Line number
}
```

### Key Components

1. Parser System

   - Front matter extraction
   - Markdown parsing
   - Section detection
   - Link extraction
   - Code block handling

2. Relationship Detector

   - Link analysis
   - Dependency extraction
   - Reference tracking
   - Graph building

3. Metadata Generator
   - Content statistics
   - Complexity analysis
   - Reading time calculation

### Processing Pipeline

1. File Change Detection
2. Content Loading
3. Front Matter Parsing
4. Content Structure Analysis
5. Relationship Extraction
6. Metadata Generation
7. Database Storage

## Dependencies

- gray-matter for front matter
- marked for markdown
- existing database system
- file watcher integration

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests

   - Parser components
   - Relationship detection
   - Metadata generation

2. Integration Tests
   - Full pipeline processing
   - Database integration
   - Change handling

## Notes

- Handle malformed content gracefully
- Consider caching parsed results
- Plan for large files
- Monitor memory usage

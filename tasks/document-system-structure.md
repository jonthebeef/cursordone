# Document System Structure

## Objectives
1. Document current directory structure
2. Map out component relationships
3. Document file naming conventions
4. Document front matter schema
5. Create system architecture diagram

## Success Criteria
- [x] Directory structure documented
- [x] Component relationships mapped
- [x] File naming conventions documented
- [x] Front matter schema documented
- [x] Architecture diagram created

## Notes
This documentation will serve as the foundation for our template structure and future development.

## Implementation Notes
Created comprehensive system architecture documentation in `docs/system-architecture.md` that includes:

1. **Directory Structure**
   - Detailed tree view of project organization
   - Component and file locations
   - Purpose of each directory

2. **Component Relationships**
   - Core components and their interactions
   - Data flow diagrams for key operations
   - UI component hierarchy

3. **File Naming Conventions**
   - Standardized formats for tasks, epics, and docs
   - Examples and explanations
   - Timestamp usage for uniqueness

4. **Front Matter Schema**
   - Complete schema for tasks, epics, and docs
   - Field descriptions and types
   - Required vs optional fields

5. **Additional Documentation**
   - System features overview
   - Implementation notes
   - Performance considerations
   - State management approach

## Overview

This document outlines various strategies for implementing team collaboration in CursorDone while maintaining its local-first architecture. Each approach is analyzed for its benefits, drawbacks, and implementation complexity.

## 1. Git-Based Sync (MVP Approach)

### Architecture

- Tasks and epics stored as markdown files sync through standard Git workflows
- Local filesystem remains source of truth
- Git handles versioning, conflict resolution, and change tracking

### Benefits

- Zero additional infrastructure required
- Leverages existing Git knowledge and workflows
- Natural integration with code version control
- Offline-first by design
- Built-in audit trail through Git history

### Drawbacks

- Manual sync required (git pull/push)
- Potential for merge conflicts in task metadata
- No real-time collaboration features
- Team members need Git knowledge

### Implementation Complexity: Low

- Minimal changes to existing architecture
- Relies on Git's proven conflict resolution
- No additional servers or services needed

## 2. Supabase Real-time Sync

### Architecture

- Local files remain source of truth
- Supabase provides real-time sync layer
- Changes propagate through Postgres real-time subscriptions
- Local cache with offline support

### Benefits

- Real-time updates between team members
- Built-in conflict resolution through Postgres
- Leverages existing Supabase integration
- Maintains offline capability
- Simpler than full CRDT implementation

### Drawbacks

- Requires hosting Supabase instance
- Additional complexity in sync logic
- Potential scaling limitations
- Higher operational costs

### Implementation Complexity: Medium

- Requires sync protocol implementation
- Need to handle offline/online transitions
- Must implement conflict resolution strategy

## 3. CRDT-Based Sync

### Architecture

- Implement CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) for task data
- Use YJS or Automerge for automatic merging
- Light WebSocket relay server for peer discovery
- Local-first with eventual consistency

### Benefits

- True local-first architecture
- Automatic conflict resolution
- Real-time collaboration
- No central authority needed
- Excellent offline support

### Drawbacks

- Complex implementation
- Requires relay server
- Learning curve for team
- Potentially larger storage requirements

### Implementation Complexity: High

- Need deep understanding of CRDTs
- Complex state management
- Must handle various network conditions

## 4. Hybrid Local + Cloud (Enterprise)

### Architecture

- Local files as primary storage
- Optional cloud sync layer (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
- Self-hosted or managed sync server
- Configurable sync strategies

### Benefits

- Flexible deployment options
- Enterprise-ready features
- Maintains local-first benefits
- Customizable sync frequency
- Advanced access controls

### Drawbacks

- Most complex implementation
- Higher operational costs
- Multiple sync paths to maintain
- More complex deployment

### Implementation Complexity: Very High

- Multiple storage backends
- Complex deployment options
- Enterprise feature requirements

## Recommendation

For initial team collaboration implementation, we recommend the Git-based sync approach because:

1. Minimal changes to current architecture
2. Zero additional infrastructure
3. Familiar workflow for developers
4. Can be enhanced later with other sync strategies
5. Provides immediate value with low risk

Future iterations can layer additional sync strategies based on user needs and feedback.

## Next Steps

1. Document Git workflow best practices
2. Implement conflict resolution guidelines
3. Create team onboarding documentation
4. Consider automation for common sync operations
5. Plan for monitoring and analytics

Create a detailed implementation plan for the new tag system based on the approved design, covering both frontend and backend changes required.

## Requirements

### Frontend Implementation Plan
- [ ] Break down Command component integration
- [ ] Plan UI component updates
- [ ] Define state management changes
- [ ] Plan performance optimizations
- [ ] Document component dependencies

### Backend Implementation Plan
- [ ] Design API endpoints for tag operations
- [ ] Plan data storage optimizations
- [ ] Define caching strategy
- [ ] Plan search/suggestion implementation
- [ ] Document database schema changes

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Define unit test requirements
- [ ] Plan integration test coverage
- [ ] Design performance test scenarios
- [ ] Plan user acceptance testing
- [ ] Define success metrics

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create detailed task breakdown
- [ ] Estimate implementation effort

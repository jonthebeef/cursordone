Test the Supabase Edge Function for subscription status checking. Include:

1. Simulate valid and invalid requests to the function.
2. Validate responses for various scenarios (e.g., active, expired subscriptions).
3. Ensure the function handles errors gracefully and logs issues for debugging.

Deliverable:

- Fully tested Edge Function with documentation for testing scenarios.
- No errors or crashes under valid/invalid inputs.

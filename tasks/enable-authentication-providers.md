Enable Discord and GitHub OAuth authentication in Supabase. Perform the following steps:

1. Configure GitHub OAuth in the Supabase dashboard:

   - Set the authorization callback URL to `<SUPABASE_URL>/auth/v1/callback`.
   - Obtain and store the client ID and client secret in Supabase settings.

2. Configure Discord OAuth in the Supabase dashboard:

   - Set the redirect URI to `<SUPABASE_URL>/auth/v1/callback`.
   - Obtain and store the client ID and client secret in Supabase settings.

3. Add redirect URLs for local (`http://localhost:3000`) and production environments in Supabase settings.

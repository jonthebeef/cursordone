# Separate System from Content

Create a clean separation between the core system and the content/data, enabling safe system restructuring while preserving the working instance.

## Context

We need to separate the core task management system from the actual task content to enable safe restructuring and templating while protecting the working instance we're using for dogfooding.

## Implementation Notes

- Create parallel development approach
- Document separation strategy
- Ensure safe testing methodology
- Maintain working instance integrity

## Requirements Checklist

### Analysis

- [ ] Map core system components
- [ ] Identify content/data elements
- [ ] Document dependencies
- [ ] Create separation strategy

### Parallel Development Setup

- [ ] Create clean clone of project
- [ ] Setup parallel development environment
- [ ] Document differences between instances
- [ ] Create sync strategy

### System vs Content Separation

- [ ] Identify system components
- [ ] Map content storage
- [ ] Document integration points
- [ ] Create clear boundaries

### Testing Strategy

- [ ] Develop parallel testing approach
- [ ] Create verification checklist
- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Setup comparison methodology

## Success Criteria

- Clear separation between system and content
- Working parallel development environment
- Documented integration points
- Safe testing methodology
- Preserved working instance
- Clear path to system improvements

## Risk Mitigation

- Keep working instance untouched
- Test all changes in parallel
- Document all integration points
- Create clear rollback procedures
- Maintain content integrity

## Guidelines

- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

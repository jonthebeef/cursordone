Validate Supabase database migrations to ensure schema integrity. Steps include:

1. Apply migrations to a test database.
2. Verify all tables (`Users`, optional `Projects`) are created with correct fields and constraints.
3. Test database interactions (CRUD operations) for `Users` and `Projects` tables.

Deliverable:
- Successful migration and validation of the database schema.
- Test cases for CRUD operations documented.

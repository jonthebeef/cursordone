Create a centralized admin dashboard for managing AI features and monitoring usage across all installations, leveraging PostHog for feature flags and analytics.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] PostHog project setup with feature flags and analytics
- [ ] Secure admin dashboard deployed on Vercel/Netlify
- [ ] Real-time feature flag management through PostHog
- [ ] Usage monitoring and analytics in PostHog
- [ ] Custom alert system integrated with PostHog metrics
- [ ] Ability to control AI features across all installations

## Implementation Details

### 1. PostHog Integration

```typescript
// PostHog feature flag configuration
interface AIFeatureFlags {
  "ai-enhancement-enabled": boolean;
  "ai-model-version": "deepseek-chat-r1" | "deepseek-chat-v3";
  "ai-max-daily-tokens": number;
  "ai-max-request-tokens": number;
}

// PostHog event tracking
interface AIUsageEvent {
  event: "ai_enhancement_used";
  properties: {
    installation_id: string;
    model: string;
    prompt_tokens: number;
    completion_tokens: number;
    total_tokens: number;
    estimated_cost: number;
    success: boolean;
    error?: string;
  };
  timestamp: string;
}

// PostHog user properties
interface InstallationProperties {
  installation_id: string;
  version: string;
  total_usage: number;
  total_cost: number;
  last_active: string;
  health_status: "healthy" | "warning" | "error";
}
```

### 2. Admin Dashboard Features

1. Feature Flag Management (PostHog)

   - Global enable/disable through PostHog
   - Model selection via feature flags
   - Token limits in feature flags
   - Rollout rules and targeting
   - Change history in PostHog

2. Usage Analytics (PostHog)

   - Real-time usage in PostHog dashboards
   - Cost tracking via custom metrics
   - Usage patterns and trends
   - Installation-specific analytics
   - Export capabilities

3. Alert System

   - PostHog-based metric alerts
   - Custom threshold monitoring
   - Integration with Slack/email
   - Error rate tracking
   - Usage spike detection

4. Installation Management
   - PostHog user profiles for installations
   - Individual installation metrics
   - Feature flag targeting
   - Health monitoring

### 3. Security Implementation

1. Authentication

   - PostHog team management
   - Role-based access in PostHog
   - Audit logging through PostHog
   - 2FA requirement

2. API Security
   - PostHog API authentication
   - Rate limiting
   - IP whitelisting
   - Audit trails

### 4. Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// Dashboard layout using PostHog components
interface DashboardLayout {
  sections: {
    featureFlags: {
      posthogFlags: PostHogFeatureFlagsList;
      targeting: PostHogTargetingRules;
    };
    metrics: {
      posthogDashboards: PostHogCustomDashboard[];
      trends: PostHogTrendsView;
      funnels: PostHogFunnelView;
    };
    alerts: {
      posthogAlerts: PostHogAlertsList;
      configuration: AlertSettings;
      history: AlertHistory;
    };
    installations: {
      users: PostHogUsersList;
      cohorts: PostHogCohortsList;
      health: HealthStatus;
    };
  };
}
```

### 5. Backend Services

1. Data Collection

   - PostHog event capture
   - Custom event processing
   - Historical data in PostHog

2. Alert Processing

   - PostHog-based alerting
   - Custom alert rules
   - Notification dispatch

3. Admin API
   - PostHog API integration
   - Feature flag management
   - Metrics retrieval
   - Installation management

## Implementation Steps

1. PostHog Setup

   - [ ] Create PostHog project
   - [ ] Configure feature flags
   - [ ] Set up event capture
   - [ ] Create dashboards

2. Integration

   - [ ] Implement PostHog client
   - [ ] Set up event tracking
   - [ ] Configure feature flags
   - [ ] Add user identification

3. Frontend

   - [ ] Create admin interface
   - [ ] Integrate PostHog components
   - [ ] Add custom visualizations
   - [ ] Build management interfaces

4. Testing
   - [ ] Feature flag testing
   - [ ] Analytics verification
   - [ ] Load testing
   - [ ] Integration testing

## Notes

- PostHog provides most of the infrastructure we need
- Use PostHog's A/B testing capabilities
- Leverage PostHog's session recording for debugging
- Consider self-hosting PostHog for more control
- Use PostHog's correlation analysis for insights

## Guidelines

- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

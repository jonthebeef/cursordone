# Clean System Structure

## Objectives

1. Remove all test and sample tasks
2. Document current system structure
3. Create template structure for new installations
4. Establish migration guidelines

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All test/sample content removed
- [ ] System structure documented
- [ ] Template structure created
- [ ] Migration guide written

## Notes

This is the first step in rebuilding the system. We need to start with a clean slate while documenting everything we need to preserve.

Before commencing work, give a full outline of planned activity and implications to the user to explain your approach.

## Guidelines

- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

# Fix Session Management Issues

Implement improvements to the client-side session management to resolve persistence and race condition issues.

## Implementation Notes

1. Race Condition Fixes:
   - Added `mountedRef` to track component mounting state
   - Added `checkingRef` to prevent multiple simultaneous auth checks
   - Implemented safe state updates with proper cleanup
   - Removed setTimeout-based loading states
   - Added `safeSetState` utility to prevent state updates on unmounted components

2. Session Cleanup Improvements:
   - Enhanced `secureStorage` with comprehensive cleanup
   - Added validation for session structure and expiration
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Added state management for OAuth flow
   - Implemented cleanup confirmation through proper state transitions

3. Client/Server State Consistency:
   - Simplified loading state management
   - Added proper error boundaries
   - Improved redirect handling with path validation
   - Consolidated auth state management in useSession hook
   - Removed redundant state management in components

4. Files Modified:
   | File | Changes Made |
   |------|--------------|
   | `lib/hooks/use-session.ts` | Added race condition prevention and safe state updates |
   | `components/providers/auth-provider.tsx` | Simplified loading states and improved mount handling |
   | `lib/utils/secure-storage.ts` | Enhanced session cleanup and validation |
   | `app/auth/layout.tsx` | Improved auth state transitions and redirect handling |

5. Testing Results:
   - ✅ Session cleanup: All auth-related data properly cleared on logout
   - ✅ Race conditions: No flickering or duplicate auth checks during navigation
   - ✅ State consistency: Synchronized state between tabs, proper cleanup
   - ✅ Error handling: Clear error messages, proper redirects
   - ✅ Loading states: Smooth transitions, no content flashing

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Sessions are properly cleared on logout
2. ✅ No race conditions during auth state transitions
3. ✅ Consistent session state between client/server
4. ✅ Clear error messages for auth issues
5. ✅ Proper loading states during transitions

## Testing Instructions

1. ✅ Test login flow with different providers
2. ✅ Verify logout cleans up properly
3. ✅ Check state transitions
4. ✅ Validate error handling
5. ✅ Test session recovery

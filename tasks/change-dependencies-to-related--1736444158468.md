We talk about dependencies, but the tasks you attach or actually more relations than direct dependencies. Where we do have dependencies, we should put them in the ticket content, rather than as related tickets

Can you change the UI and front matter, where we talk about dependencies or parent tasks, and change that to "related tasks"

## Guidelines

- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

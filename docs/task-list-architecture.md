# Task List Architecture

## Overview

The task list system has been refactored into a modular, performant architecture that separates concerns and improves maintainability. This document outlines the component structure, state management, and key features.

## Component Structure

### TaskListContainer

- **Purpose**: Main orchestration component that manages global state and layout
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Task filtering and sorting
  - Drag-and-drop coordination
  - Section state management
  - Dialog state management
- **Key Features**:
  - Optimized re-renders with useMemo
  - Virtualized task sections for performance
  - Smooth loading states and transitions

### TaskListHeader

- **Purpose**: Search and sort controls for task list
- **Components**:
  - Search input with clear button
  - Sort dropdown
  - Create task button
- **Features**:
  - Debounced search input
  - Persistent sort preferences

### TaskSection

- **Purpose**: Groups tasks by status (todo, in-progress, done)
- **Features**:
  - Collapsible sections
  - Drag-and-drop support
  - Virtualized task rendering
  - Performance optimizations for large lists
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses @tanstack/react-virtual for efficient rendering
  - Maintains smooth scrolling with overscan
  - Handles dynamic content heights

### TaskItem

- **Purpose**: Individual task display component
- **Features**:
  - Task metadata display
  - Status indicators
  - Action buttons
  - Drag handle
- **Optimizations**:
  - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Efficient update handling

### Dialog Components

#### TaskCreationDialog

- **Purpose**: Form for creating new tasks
- **Features**:
  - Rich text editor
  - Image and file uploads
  - Tag management
  - Dependencies selection
  - Epic assignment

#### TaskEditDialog

- **Purpose**: Form for editing existing tasks
- **Features**:
  - Full task editing capabilities
  - State preservation during edits
  - Validation and error handling
  - Real-time updates

#### TaskViewDialog

- **Purpose**: Read-only task details display
- **Features**:
  - Markdown content rendering
  - Metadata display
  - Dependencies view
  - Quick edit access

## State Management

- Local state for UI interactions
- Server state for task data
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Proper error handling and recovery

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Virtualization**

   - Implemented in TaskSection for large lists
   - Configurable overscan for smooth scrolling
   - Dynamic height handling

2. **Memoization**

   - Filtered tasks
   - Sorted tasks
   - Individual task items
   - Complex computations

3. **Loading States**
   - Initial data loading
   - Task updates
   - Search and filter operations
   - Smooth transitions

## Data Flow

1. Tasks loaded in TasksWrapper
2. Filtered and sorted in TaskListContainer
3. Distributed to TaskSections
4. Rendered efficiently with virtualization
5. Updated through dialog components
6. Changes reflected immediately with optimistic updates

## Future Considerations

1. **Testing**

   - Component unit tests
   - Integration tests for drag-and-drop
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Extensibility**

   - Plugin system for custom views
   - Additional sorting options
   - Enhanced filtering capabilities

3. **Performance**
   - Further optimizations for larger datasets
   - Caching improvements
   - Background updates

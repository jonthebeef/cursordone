Add the ability to star/pin important tags so they always appear at the top of the tag list in the sidebar, improving organization and quick access to frequently used tags.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Add ability to star/pin tags via a button in the tag list
- Starred tags should appear in a separate section at the top of the tag list
- Star status must persist between sessions
- Maintain existing tag filtering functionality for starred tags

### UI/UX
- Add star icon button next to each tag in sidebar
- Visual distinction for starred vs unstarred tags
- Smooth animation when starring/unstarring
- Clear section separation between starred and regular tags
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment with existing sidebar elements

### Data Management
- Create storage mechanism for starred tag state
- Handle edge cases (e.g., deleted tags, renamed tags)
- Ensure starred status persists across sessions
- Consider implementing a limit on number of starred tags

### Implementation Notes
- Store starred tags in a JSON file (similar to task-order implementation)
- Add API endpoint for managing starred status
- Update sidebar component to handle starred tags section
- Add proper error handling and loading states

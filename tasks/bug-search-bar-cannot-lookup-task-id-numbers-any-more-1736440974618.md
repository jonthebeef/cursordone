The search bar was very good at being able to enter either words from a task title or the ID ref. as we are using the ID refs in general discussion, it's helpful to be able to look them up quickly.

Since we implemente the clear feature in the search the ability to lookup by task number seems to have gone. please reintroduce this critical capability.

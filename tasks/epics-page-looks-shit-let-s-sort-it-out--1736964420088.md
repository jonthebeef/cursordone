The epics are nowhere near as polished as tasks, or other parts of the system. Let's give them the respect they deserve

- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

Right now, if I use our rather excellent search, there isn't a way for me to quickly clear it. I have to delete the content in there instead.

it would be far easier if the search had a clear button, which would remove the data inside it. can you make this happen please 

# Implementation Notes

Added a clear button to the search input field:

1. Modified the search input in `components/task-list.tsx`:
   - Added conditional rendering for clear button (X icon) that appears when search has text
   - Used `lucide-react` X icon component for consistency
   - Added proper positioning with absolute positioning and transform
   - Added hover states for better interactivity

2. Styling details:
   - Button positioned absolutely on the right side of input
   - Used text-zinc-400 with hover:text-zinc-300 for subtle interaction
   - Added padding for better touch target
   - Ensured proper spacing with input text (pr-8 on input)

3. Functionality:
   - Clear button appears only when searchQuery has content
   - Clicking clear button sets searchQuery to empty string
   - Maintains existing search functionality
   - Immediate UI feedback when clearing search

4. Accessibility:
   - Button has proper type="button" to prevent form submission
   - Clear icon provides visual affordance
   - Hover states for better UX

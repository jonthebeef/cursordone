We need to be able to add important docs to the project, such as PRDs, architecture docs, and other things. All in the name if giving you, the robot, greater context about the project.

Can you introduce a docs feature and page, which lists docs that have been added to a directory with front matter. I should also be able to create docs in the web ui in markdown (like I can tasks and epics). spec out what front matter these markdown files will need to have, as these are an important top of ladder

- Docs inform
- Epics, which have
- Tasks

Discuss with me the planned implementation, and any changes we need to make to the overall complexity

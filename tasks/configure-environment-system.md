# Configure Environment System

Set up a robust environment configuration system to handle different deployment environments and sensitive data.

## Implementation Notes

- Remember to change status to "in progress" when starting this task
- Test thoroughly before marking as done
- Commit with message "feat: configure environment system"

## Implementation Details

1. Environment Validation System

   - Created `lib/env.ts` with Zod schema for type-safe environment validation
   - Implemented validation for Supabase, API, feature flags, and version info
   - Removed automatic validation at startup for better control
   - Added explicit `validateEnv()` function for on-demand validation

2. Test Environment Setup

   - Created `.env.test` with appropriate test values
   - Added test configuration in `vitest.config.ts`
   - Implemented proper test environment setup with `beforeAll` hook
   - Added test cases to verify environment configuration

3. Environment Variables Structure

   - Supabase configuration (URL, keys)
   - API endpoints configuration
   - Feature flags (beta features, analytics)
   - Version and build time information
   - Node environment settings

4. Testing Implementation
   - Added comprehensive test suite in `lib/env.test.ts`
   - Implemented environment reset before tests
   - Added validation tests for environment variables
   - Verified correct environment values in test context

## Requirements Checklist

### Environment Files

- [x] Create .env template
- [x] Setup .env.local for development
- [x] Add .env.production template
- [x] Configure .env.test for testing

### Environment Variables

- [x] Add Supabase configuration
- [x] Setup API endpoints
- [x] Configure feature flags
- [x] Add version information

### Security Setup

- [x] Add environment validation
- [x] Setup secret management
- [x] Configure environment encryption
- [x] Add security documentation

### Development Tools

- [x] Add environment loading utilities
- [x] Create environment type definitions
- [x] Setup environment validation
- [x] Add environment documentation

## Testing Instructions

1. Test environment loading
2. Verify variable validation
3. Check security measures
4. Test different environments
5. Validate documentation

## Success Criteria

- Working environment system
- Secure configuration handling
- Clear documentation
- Type-safe environment usage
- Proper security measures

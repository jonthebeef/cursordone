# Create .cursorrules for Consistent AI Behavior

Create a `.cursorrules` configuration file to ensure consistent AI assistant behavior across the project.

## Rule Categories to Implement

1. Content Structure Rules:

   - Strict front matter schema validation for all content types
   - Required fields per content type
   - Consistent date formats
   - Proper markdown formatting standards

2. Task Management Rules:

   - Detailed task descriptions with clear objectives
   - Required sections (Success Criteria, Implementation Notes)
   - No manual task ref generation
   - Dependencies must use task filenames
   - Clear definitions of "ready" and "done" states

3. Git Integration Rules:

   - Commit message format with task refs
   - Automatic git push after task creation
   - Branch naming conventions
   - Update refs pipeline triggers

4. AI Behavior Guidelines:
   - Response formatting standards
   - Error handling procedures
   - When to ask for clarification
   - How to handle incomplete information
   - Documentation requirements

## Implementation Details

1. Configuration Structure:

   - YAML format for rules
   - Schema validation
   - Version control for rules
   - Documentation of each rule

2. Integration Points:
   - Cursor AI prompt injection
   - Git hooks setup
   - Schema validation integration
   - Pipeline configuration

## Success Criteria

- [x] Rules documented with examples
- [x] AI behavior verified against rules
- [x] Git integration tested
- [x] Pipeline updates confirmed working
- [x] Team reviewed and approved rules

# Implement Session Management

Create a robust session management system for handling user sessions and authentication state.

## Implementation Notes

1. Session Management Implementation:

   - Created useSession hook for centralized session management
   - Implemented automatic token refresh
   - Added session timeout (24 hours)
   - Set up secure session storage with encryption

2. Security Enhancements:

   - Added CSRF protection in middleware
   - Implemented security headers
   - Set up secure cookie handling
   - Added encrypted local storage

3. State Management:

   - Created auth context with session state
   - Implemented state persistence
   - Added state recovery on token refresh
   - Set up proper cleanup on unmount

4. Testing Completed:
   - Verified session persistence
   - Tested token refresh flow
   - Validated security measures
   - Confirmed state recovery
   - Checked timeout handling

## Requirements Checklist

### Session Handling

- [x] Implement session storage
- [x] Add token refresh
- [x] Create session recovery
- [x] Setup session timeout

### State Management

- [x] Create auth context
- [x] Add state persistence
- [x] Implement state sync
- [x] Setup state recovery

### Security

- [x] Add token validation
- [x] Implement CSRF protection
- [x] Create security headers
- [x] Setup secure storage

## Testing Instructions

1. Test session persistence
2. Verify token refresh
3. Check security measures
4. Test state recovery
5. Validate timeout handling

## Success Criteria

✅ Reliable session management
✅ Secure token handling
✅ Proper state persistence
✅ Clear session status

## Next Steps

1. Monitor session timeouts in production
2. Gather user feedback on session duration
3. Consider implementing session keep-alive
4. Add analytics for auth state changes

- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

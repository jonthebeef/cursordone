# Enable the sorted order of tasks to be saved between sessions

status: done
tags: [10 jan]

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented task order persistence with the following features:
- Task order is now saved between sessions using a JSON file storage system
- Implemented a new API route `/api/task-order` to handle order persistence
- Added order loading on component mount and filter changes
- Improved UI with a modern Select dropdown for sorting options:
  - Default Order (manual drag & drop)
  - Date Added (Newest/Oldest)
  - Priority (High to Low/Low to High)
- Responsive design improvements:
  - Optimized header layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
  - Search field, sort dropdown, and create button properly aligned
  - Improved spacing and touch targets
- Order is maintained separately for different views (all tasks, epics, tags)
- Drag and drop functionality works seamlessly with order persistence

The feature is now complete and working as expected, with proper error handling and fallbacks in place.

There is too much space above the heading on the task list screen. Lets remove this to pull the heading and button top aligned with the app name in the sidebar

Can you also fix the search and create task button in a fixed area at the top of the task view so these features are always accessible to the user no matter how far they've scrolled down the tasks.

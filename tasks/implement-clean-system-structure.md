# Implement Clean System Structure

Clean and standardize the system structure to prepare for package distribution and ensure maintainability. This task focuses on implementing the clean structure in the template/parallel version after system and content separation is complete.

## Context

After separating the system from content (dependency task), we'll implement a clean, standardized structure in the template version. This ensures we can safely reorganize without affecting the working instance.

## Implementation Notes

- Work in the template/parallel version only
- Document all structural changes
- Create clear upgrade path
- Maintain separation of concerns

## Requirements Checklist

### Directory Structure Cleanup

- [ ] Remove test/sample content
- [ ] Organize components directory
- [ ] Structure lib directory
- [ ] Clean up public assets

### Code Organization

- [ ] Standardize file naming
- [ ] Organize imports
- [ ] Clean up unused code
- [ ] Structure types/interfaces

### Documentation Structure

- [ ] Organize documentation files
- [ ] Update README files
- [ ] Clean up comments
- [ ] Structure API documentation

### Configuration Cleanup

- [ ] Clean package.json
- [ ] Organize config files
- [ ] Update build scripts
- [ ] Clean development tools

## Testing Instructions

1. Verify all directories follow structure
2. Check for unused files/code
3. Validate import organization
4. Test build process
5. Verify documentation links

## Success Criteria

- Clean, organized directory structure
- No unused code or files
- Clear documentation organization
- Working build process
- Maintainable code structure
- Safe upgrade path for working instances

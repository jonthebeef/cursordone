# Task Details Sheet Spacing Issue

The task details sheet has inconsistent spacing at the bottom when scrolling through content.

## Current Issues

1. Excessive spacing appears at the bottom of the sheet when scrolling
2. Content layout is not properly constrained within the sheet
3. Mixed layout approaches (flexbox + fixed heights) causing inconsistencies

## Required Changes

1. Implement consistent flexbox layout:

   - Proper flex container setup in SheetContent
   - Correct flex child constraints
   - Remove conflicting height calculations

2. Fix scroll container:
   - Ensure proper overflow handling
   - Remove redundant padding/margins
   - Fix content height constraints

# Success Criteria

- [x] Fix excessive space at bottom of task view/edit dialogs
- [x] Ensure consistent layout between view and edit modes
- [x] Maintain all functionality while improving the layout

# Implementation Notes

## Layout Investigation & Solutions Attempted

1. Initial attempts focused on CSS Grid and Flex adjustments:

   - Tried removing `h-full` and adjusting padding
   - Experimented with different flex container configurations
   - Attempted to control dialog height with fixed values

2. Dialog Component Issues:

   - Discovered issues with shadcn Dialog's default vertical centering
   - Identified conflicts between fixed positioning and transform properties
   - Tested custom modal implementation before reverting to shadcn

3. State Management Challenges:
   - Fixed flickering save button caused by aggressive polling
   - Implemented local disabled state to prevent interference from parent updates
   - Added checks to prevent state updates during save operations

## Final Solution Components

1. Dialog Layout:

   - Removed vertical centering transforms
   - Set explicit height constraints (`max-h-[85vh]`)
   - Implemented proper flex column layout with header/footer as `flex-none`
   - Added consistent padding and border styling

2. Content Organization:

   - Metadata grid at top (complexity, priority, status)
   - Epic and tags in flexible row layout
   - Content section with proper spacing
   - Dependencies section at bottom

3. Dependency List Optimization:

   - Implemented virtualization using @tanstack/react-virtual
   - Only renders visible dependency items in the DOM
   - Solved the space reservation issue for large lists
   - Maintains smooth scrolling with proper height calculations

4. State Management:
   - Protected state updates during save operations
   - Improved resilience against parent component refreshes
   - Better handling of dialog open/close states

## Key Learnings

1. Dialog positioning in Next.js requires careful consideration of transform properties
2. Large lists benefit significantly from virtualization
3. State management during save operations needs explicit protection
4. Consistent layout patterns improve maintainability

| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `components/ui/task-list.tsx`                       | Restructured view dialog layout, improved metadata organization |
| `components/ui/task-list/task-edit-dialog-test.tsx` | Implemented virtualized dependency list, fixed state management |
| `package.json`                                      | Added @tanstack/react-virtual dependency                        |

# Implementation Details

The task dialog layout issues required multiple approaches before finding the right solution. The key was understanding that the space issues came from multiple sources:

1. Dialog positioning and transform properties
2. Content layout and flex container behavior
3. Large lists causing layout calculations
4. State management affecting UI stability

The final solution combines proper layout structure with optimized rendering through virtualization, creating a stable and performant dialog component.

- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

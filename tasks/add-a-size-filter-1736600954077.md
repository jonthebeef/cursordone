We need a separate sorter in the top nav next to the search bar, that enables us to filter the tasks by t-shirt size. this would enable us to see the effort required by all tasks, or epics, tags, or epics and tags.

Does this make sense?

We also need this to work responsively at tablet and mobile sizes, and ensure it doesn't confict with other UI elements, but still looks awesome on desktop which is our target resolution

When I update a task, while the edit saved, it isn't immediately shown in web.

For example

When I change the priority in the task, when I look at the task list, the priority is what I just set it to.

right now, it takes a browser refresh to reflect the changes

## Guidelines

- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

You've added 2 labels to the front of the task to communicate:

- owner
- worker

please can you

- remove owner completely from the task card, should only be visible in the dialog
- add the worker into a circle towards the right hand of the card that shows either AI (if you have picked it up) or the user's avatar (falling back to U if no avatar available)
- also show the worker in the task card dialog

here's a drawing

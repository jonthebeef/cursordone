Implement a file watching system that monitors and triggers updates when task, epic, or documentation files change.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] File watcher successfully monitors tasks/, epics/, and docs/ directories
- [ ] Change events are properly detected (create, modify, delete)
- [ ] Change events are debounced to prevent excessive processing
- [ ] File watcher can be started/stopped gracefully
- [ ] Error handling for file system events is implemented
- [ ] Tests verify watcher behavior

## Implementation Details

### File Watcher Setup

```typescript
interface FileWatcherConfig {
  directories: string[]; // Directories to watch
  debounceMs: number; // Debounce time in ms
  ignorePatterns: string[]; // Patterns to ignore
}

interface FileChangeEvent {
  type: "create" | "modify" | "delete";
  path: string; // Relative path
  timestamp: number; // Event timestamp
}
```

### Key Components

1. Watcher Service

   - Use chokidar for cross-platform compatibility
   - Implement singleton pattern for global state
   - Add configuration options

2. Event Handler

   - Debounce change events
   - Filter relevant files
   - Queue changes for processing

3. Error Handling
   - Handle common fs errors
   - Implement retry logic
   - Log issues appropriately

### Integration Points

- Hook into existing file system utilities
- Prepare events for indexing system
- Add monitoring/logging hooks

## Dependencies

- chokidar for file watching
- rxjs for event handling
- existing fs utilities

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests

   - Event detection
   - Debouncing logic
   - Error handling

2. Integration Tests
   - File system interactions
   - Event propagation
   - System stability

## Notes

- Consider OS-specific issues
- Monitor memory usage
- Plan for large directories

# Refactor Task List Component

Break down the large task list component into smaller, more focused components to improve maintainability and performance.

## Current Issues

1. Component Size:

   - Over 1000 lines of code
   - Multiple complex responsibilities
   - Difficult to maintain and test
   - Performance concerns with large render scope

2. State Management:
   - Too many state variables in one place
   - Complex state interactions
   - Difficult to track state changes
   - Risk of unnecessary re-renders

## Implementation Details

1. New Component Structure:

   - `TaskListContainer`: Main orchestration component

     - Handles global state
     - Manages component communication
     - Controls layout and organization

   - `TaskCreationDialog`:

     - Form state and validation
     - Image upload handling
     - Tag management
     - Dependencies selection

   - `TaskEditDialog`:

     - Edit form logic
     - State management for edits
     - Validation rules
     - Update handling

   - `TaskViewDialog`:

     - Read-only task display
     - Metadata presentation
     - Action buttons
     - Status management

   - `TaskSection`:

     - Section-specific logic (todo/in-progress/done)
     - Drag and drop handling
     - Task ordering
     - Section collapse state

   - `ImageUploader`:

     - Image upload UI
     - File handling
     - Preview generation
     - Error management

   - `TaskSearch`:

     - Search input
     - Results filtering
     - Debounced queries
     - Clear functionality

   - `TaskFilters`:
     - Filter UI
     - Tag selection
     - Epic filtering
     - Combined filter logic

2. State Management Improvements:

   - Move state closer to where it's used
   - Implement proper state lifting
   - Add context where needed
   - Optimize re-renders

3. Performance Optimizations:
   - Add memo where beneficial
   - Implement virtualization for long lists
   - Optimize drag and drop
   - Add loading states

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All components split into logical units
- [ ] No component exceeds 300 lines
- [ ] Clear component interfaces defined
- [ ] State management simplified
- [ ] Performance metrics improved
- [ ] No functionality regression
- [ ] Tests updated for new structure

## Technical Considerations

- Need to maintain existing functionality
- Should improve component reusability
- Must handle state transitions smoothly
- Consider impact on existing tests
- Plan for future extensibility

Implement the core data structure and storage system for task archiving functionality.

## Requirements

### Data Structure
- Add archive status to task metadata
- Implement archive date tracking
- Store archive reason (optional field)
- Preserve all existing task relationships

### Storage System
- Create storage mechanism for archive data
- Ensure data persistence across sessions
- Handle file system operations efficiently
- Maintain data integrity during operations

### API Layer
- Create API endpoints for archive operations:
  - Archive single task
  - Restore single task
  - Get archive status
  - Update archive metadata
- Implement proper error handling
- Add validation for archive operations

### Data Migration
- Handle existing tasks gracefully
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Add migration utilities if needed
- Preserve existing task data

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Archive status can be added to tasks
- [ ] Archive data is properly stored and persisted
- [ ] API endpoints are functional and validated
- [ ] Existing tasks are handled correctly
- [ ] All operations maintain data integrity

# Add in progress state to tasks (TSK-101)

Add an "in progress" state to tasks, allowing them to be marked as started but not yet complete.

## Implementation Checklist

### Data Layer Changes ✅
- Updated Task interface to support "in progress" status
- Updated task parsing/validation to handle new status
- Ensured task file front matter supports new status
- Updated utility functions to handle new status

### Task List Component Changes ✅
- Added "In Progress" section to task list layout
- Updated task filtering logic to handle in-progress tasks
- Ensured task order persistence works with new section
- Verified existing drag-and-drop behavior is preserved

### Task Creation/Editing ✅
- Updated task creation dialog to include "in progress" option
- Updated task editing to support status changes
- Ensured proper validation of status changes

### Testing & Verification ✅
- Tested task creation with new status
- Tested status transitions (todo → in progress → done)
- Verified task list sections render correctly
- Confirmed existing functionality is preserved

### UI Refinements ✅
- Restored original section heading styling (removed colored backgrounds and icons)
- Fixed search and task header layout
- Made in-progress section only visible when tasks are in that state
- Removed special card styling for in-progress tasks
- Restored outlined green checkmark for completed tasks

## Implementation Notes

1. **Status Cycling**: Implemented a three-state cycle for tasks (todo → in-progress → done) via checkbox clicks.

2. **UI Recovery**: Had to retrieve some UI functionality from git history after initial implementation affected existing features:
   - Fixed header positioning and filter indicators
   - Restored epic/tag selection display
   - Recovered status change functionality in edit dialog

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Implemented the in-progress section to only appear when tasks are in that state, reducing visual clutter.

4. **Visual Consistency**: Maintained consistent card styling across all states while ensuring clear status indicators through checkbox states.

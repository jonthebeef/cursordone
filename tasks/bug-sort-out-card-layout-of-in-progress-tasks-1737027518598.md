2 things

- space is needed between task cards in progress which matches the backlog and done task layout
- the in progress checkbox is filled, and doesn't look like it can be pressed to move on into done

## Guidelines

- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

# Create Interactive Tutorial Tasks

Create a set of interactive tutorial tasks that teach users how to use the system through hands-on experience.

## Implementation Details

1. Basic UI Interactions:

   - Task completion (checkboxes)
   - Drag and drop reordering
   - Tag filtering
   - Epic selection
   - Priority setting
   - Complexity assignment

2. Tutorial Task Examples:

   ```markdown
   TSK-001: Mark this task as done

   - Teaches checkbox interaction
   - Shows status change workflow
   - Introduces completion process

   TSK-002: Drag and drop to reorder tasks

   - Shows numbered indicators
   - Teaches hold-to-drag
   - Demonstrates task ordering

   TSK-003: Filter tasks by tags

   - Uses tutorial-specific tags
   - Shows filter UI
   - Demonstrates multiple selections

   TSK-004: Create your first task

   - Opens creation dialog
   - Guides through fields
   - Explains front matter

   TSK-005: Set up .cursorrules

   - Introduces system configuration
   - Explains AI behavior rules
   - Shows where to place file
   ```

3. Progressive Learning:

   - Order tasks by complexity
   - Build on previous knowledge
   - Include visual cues
   - Provide instant feedback

4. Integration Points:
   - Part of initial system setup
   - Automatically created on first run
   - Tagged for easy filtering
   - Linked to documentation

## Implementation Notes

| File                                | Changes Made                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tasks/tutorial-1-complete-task.md` | Created first tutorial task teaching basic task completion     |
| `tasks/tutorial-2-reorder-tasks.md` | Created second tutorial task teaching drag and drop reordering |
| `tasks/tutorial-3-filter-tasks.md`  | Created third tutorial task teaching tag and epic filtering    |
| `tasks/tutorial-4-create-task.md`   | Created fourth tutorial task teaching task creation            |
| `tasks/tutorial-5-cursorrules.md`   | Created fifth tutorial task teaching system configuration      |

Progress:

- Created complete set of tutorial tasks
- Established proper dependency chain
- Added clear success criteria for each task
- Included next steps and notes sections
- Tagged all tasks appropriately
- Ensured progressive complexity (XS â†’ M)
- Added detailed implementation examples

## Success Criteria

- [x] Complete set of tutorial tasks created
- [x] Tasks demonstrate all core features
- [x] Progressive difficulty implemented
- [x] Clear instructions in each task
- [x] Tasks are interactive and functional
- [x] System recognizes task completion
- [x] Links to relevant documentation

## Technical Considerations

- Tasks must be created with correct refs
- Need to handle task completion appropriately
- Should preserve tutorial tasks on system reset
- Must work with task filtering system

# Testing and Validation

This epic focuses on testing the Supabase integration and ensuring the CLI and UI work seamlessly. It includes end-to-end, integration, and UI testing.

## Objectives

1. Validate all Supabase-driven functionality.
2. Test CLI commands and Edge Functions for robustness.
3. Ensure data integrity in the Supabase database.

## Key Features

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test user login and signup flows.
   - Test Supabase Edge Functions for subscription validation.

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Validate Supabase client CRUD operations (e.g., `Users` table).
   - Test database migrations for schema integrity.

3. **UI Testing**
   - Test authentication flows in the UI.
   - Verify that Supabase-driven data (e.g., subscription status) displays correctly.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All authentication flows (CLI and UI) are fully tested.
- [ ] Supabase database operations pass integration tests.
- [ ] Edge Functions are validated with real-world scenarios.

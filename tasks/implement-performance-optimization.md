Create a performance optimization system to monitor, analyze, and improve system performance across all components.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Performance monitoring implemented
- [ ] Resource usage optimization working
- [ ] Query optimization system in place
- [ ] Memory management optimized
- [ ] Response times within targets
- [ ] Cost optimization working

## Implementation Details

### Performance System

```typescript
interface PerformanceConfig {
  monitoring: {
    enabled: boolean;
    sampleRate: number;
    retentionDays: number;
    alertThresholds: Record<string, number>;
  };
  optimization: {
    autoTune: boolean;
    targetMetrics: Record<string, number>;
    constraints: ResourceConstraints;
  };
  resources: {
    maxMemory: number;
    maxConcurrency: number;
    maxBatchSize: number;
  };
}

interface PerformanceMetrics {
  timing: {
    queryLatency: number;
    retrievalLatency: number;
    generationLatency: number;
    totalLatency: number;
  };
  resources: {
    memoryUsage: number;
    cpuUsage: number;
    diskUsage: number;
    networkUsage: number;
  };
  costs: {
    apiCosts: number;
    computeCosts: number;
    storageCosts: number;
  };
}
```

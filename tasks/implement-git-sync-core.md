## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Branch Management

1. Branch Operations

   - ✅ Implement branch switching
   - ✅ Add branch status tracking
   - ✅ Create branch sync settings
   - ✅ Build branch status UI

2. Branch Sync Logic
   - ✅ Handle branch-specific configurations
   - ✅ Implement cross-branch operations
   - ✅ Add branch protection rules

### Phase 2: Error Handling & Recovery

1. Retry System

   - ✅ Implement exponential backoff
   - ✅ Add operation queuing
   - ✅ Create retry strategies
   - ✅ Handle persistent failures

2. State Recovery
   - ✅ Create state snapshots
   - ✅ Implement restore points
   - ✅ Add verification checks
   - ✅ Build recovery UI

### Phase 3: Testing

1. Test Infrastructure

   - ✅ Set up testing framework
   - ✅ Create mock Git operations
   - ✅ Build test scenarios
   - ✅ Add performance benchmarks

2. Test Implementation
   - ✅ Write unit tests
   - ✅ Create integration tests
   - ✅ Implement error scenarios
   - ✅ Add stress tests

### Recent Progress

1. Implemented StateManager with:

   - Snapshot creation and management
   - Restore point verification
   - State integrity checks
   - Automatic backup before restore

2. Created test suite for state recovery:

   - Snapshot management tests
   - Restore point verification
   - State restoration validation
   - Error handling scenarios

3. Added safety features:
   - State verification before restore
   - Automatic backup creation
   - Rollback on restore failure
   - Integrity checksums

### Next Steps

✅ All implementation tasks completed! Ready for review and integration.

## Guidelines

- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

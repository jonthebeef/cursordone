We need to be able to add important docs to the project, such as PRDs, architecture docs, and other things. All in the name if giving you, the robot, greater context about the project.

## Implementation
Created a full documentation management system with the following features:

### Document Structure
Documents are stored as markdown files with front matter containing:
- title: Document title
- description: Brief summary
- type: Category of document (documentation, architecture, guide, api, delivery, product, business, design, stakeholders, operations)
- tags: Array of searchable tags
- dependencies: Array of related task/epic IDs
- epic: Optional associated epic
- created: Creation timestamp

### Features Implemented
1. Document List View
   - Grid layout showing all documents
   - Type badges with distinct colors
   - Search functionality across title/description/type
   - Creation date display

2. Document Creation
   - Markdown editor with preview
   - Type selection
   - Tag management
   - Task/Epic dependency linking
   - Image and file upload support

3. Document Management
   - Full-screen document viewer
   - Edit capability
   - Delete with confirmation dialog
   - Git-aware deletion warning

4. UI/UX
   - Consistent styling with tasks/epics
   - Responsive layout
   - Markdown preview support
   - Modern dialog interfaces

The documentation system is now fully integrated with the existing task and epic management features, providing a complete project management solution.

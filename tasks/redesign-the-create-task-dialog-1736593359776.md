The current layout for the create task dialog is a little cramped, without enough focus on the content area which is the most important for setting context

can you make the create dialog bigger, to accommodate the layout change in the wireframe below?

you should

- keep this in a dialog not a separate page
- use the existing components
- introduce a text formatting component (for notion like formatting)

Currently, there's no way of seeing how close to completing an epic we are

Can you add a feature to the epic, which shows which tasks are part of it, and percentage completeness of that epic?

## Guidelines

- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer
- DO NOT STOP WORKING until task is complete
- Start reasoning paragraphs with uncertainty, then build confidence through analysis

# Implement File Locking System

Create a robust file locking mechanism to handle concurrent access and prevent conflicts.

## Implementation Notes

- Remember to change status to "in progress" when starting this task
- Test thoroughly before marking as done
- Commit with message "feat: implement file locking system"

## Requirements Checklist

### Lock Management

- [ ] Implement file locks
- [ ] Add lock timeouts
- [ ] Create lock queuing
- [ ] Setup deadlock prevention

### Concurrent Access

- [ ] Handle multiple readers
- [ ] Manage write locks
- [ ] Implement lock priorities
- [ ] Add wait queues

### Error Handling

- [ ] Handle lock failures
- [ ] Add timeout handling
- [ ] Create recovery process
- [ ] Setup notifications

## Testing Instructions

1. Test concurrent access
2. Verify lock timeouts
3. Check deadlock prevention
4. Test recovery process
5. Validate notifications

## Success Criteria

- Reliable lock system
- No deadlock situations
- Proper concurrent access
- Clear lock status feedback

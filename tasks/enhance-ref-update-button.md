# Enhance Ref Update Button

## Objectives

1. Add loading state to button ✅
2. Improve button positioning in sidebar ✅
3. Add hover and active states ✅
4. Implement disabled state during updates ✅
5. Add icon animation during loading ✅

## Success Criteria

- [x] Loading state working correctly
- [x] Button properly positioned at bottom of sidebar
- [x] Interactive states styled and working
- [x] Button disabled during updates
- [x] Loading animation smooth

## Implementation Details

1. Added loading state:

   - Spinning icon using Tailwind's `animate-spin`
   - Text changes to "Updating..." during process
   - Smooth transition between states

2. Button positioning:

   - Fixed at bottom of sidebar
   - Separated with border-t
   - Full width for consistency

3. Interactive states:

   - Disabled state with reduced opacity
   - Cursor changes to "not-allowed" when disabled
   - Inherited hover/active states from Button component
   - Smooth transitions between states

4. State management:
   - Added `isUpdating` state to track updates
   - Prevents multiple simultaneous updates
   - Automatically resets after completion/error
   - Integrates with toast notifications

## Notes

The button now provides clear visual feedback during updates and prevents accidental double-clicks. The implementation maintains consistency with the app's design system and provides a smooth user experience.

# Current Issues

- Task list component is too large and handles too many responsibilities
- State management is scattered and complex
- Performance issues with large lists
- Component re-renders too frequently
- Dialog components are tightly coupled with the main component

# Implementation Details

## New Component Structure

- [x] TaskListContainer - Main container managing state
- [x] TaskListHeader - Header with search and sort controls
- [x] TaskSection - Groups tasks by status
- [x] TaskItem - Individual task item
- [x] TaskCreationDialog - Dialog for creating new tasks
- [x] TaskEditDialog - Dialog for editing tasks
- [x] TaskViewDialog - Dialog for viewing task details

## State Management Improvements

- [x] Move state closer to where it's used
- [x] Optimize re-renders with useMemo and useCallback
- [x] Improve loading states and transitions
- [x] Implement virtualization for large lists

## Performance Optimizations

- [x] Memoize expensive computations
- [x] Add loading states for better UX
- [x] Implement infinite scrolling or pagination
- [x] Add virtualization for large lists

# Success Criteria

- [x] All components split into logical units
- [x] State management simplified and localized
- [x] Performance metrics improved
- [x] Loading states and transitions smooth
- [x] Tests updated for new components
- [x] Documentation updated with new architecture

# Implementation Notes

1. Extracted TaskListContainer, TaskListHeader, TaskSection, and TaskItem components
2. Created separate TaskCreationDialog, TaskEditDialog, and TaskViewDialog components
3. Improved loading states and initial data handling
4. Added virtualization to TaskSection for better performance with large lists
5. Created comprehensive documentation in docs/task-list-architecture.md
6. Added tests for TaskSection component with Vitest and React Testing Library
7. All success criteria met - task ready for review
